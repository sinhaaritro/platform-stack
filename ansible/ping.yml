# This is a very simple playbook to verify Ansible connectivity.

- name: Verify Connection to All Provisioned Hosts
  hosts: all # The 'all' keyword tells Ansible to run this play on every host in the inventory.
  gather_facts: no # We don't need to gather detailed facts for this simple test.

  tasks:
    - name: Ping all hosts
      ansible.builtin.ping:
        # The ping module tries to connect, executes a basic command,
        # and returns 'pong' if it is successful. This confirms that
        # SSH connectivity and python discovery are working.
