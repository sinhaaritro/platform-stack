    # It doesn't seem to patch values.yaml directly in overlay?
    # Wait, SeaweedFS `overlays/prod` has NO values.yaml patching in `kustomization.yaml` shown in step 49.
    # It just includes base and components.
    #
    # So for Grafana, I should follow suit: include base, maybe create components if needed.
    # But for simple values override, I might need to use a strategic merge patch on the `HelmRelease` if using Flux, or just rely on base values for now if they are sufficient?
    #
    # Wait, Kustomize's `helmCharts` field creates the resources.
    # If I want to override values in overlay, I should probably re-declare `helmCharts` with a different values file?
    # Or just use `patches` on the resulting Deployment/StatefulSet?
    #
    # The skill says: "Step 3: Create Profiles (Overlays)... patches: [ ../../patches/feature.yaml ]".
    #
    # So let's stick to base + patches if needed. I will creating `values.yaml` in overlay but how to use it?
    # If I re-declare `helmCharts` in overlay, it might conflict or duplicate.
    #
    # Let's check `apps/infrastructure/loki/overlays`? Step 9 showed `overlays` exists.
    # Let's verify Loki or Mimir overlays if possible later.
    #
    # For now, I will create `overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml` referencing base, and if I need values, I'll figure it out.
    # The user asked for "Same format as seaweeedfs".
    # SeaweedFS `overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml` (step 49) ONLY includes base and components.
    # So I will do the same.
