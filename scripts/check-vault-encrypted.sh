# PRE-COMMIT HOOK: Check for Unencrypted Ansible Vault Files (v2)
#
# This script is designed to be run as a Git pre-commit hook. Its purpose
# is to prevent unencrypted secret files from ever being committed to the
# repository.
#
# It works by:
# 1. Getting a list of all STAGED files for the current commit.
# 2. Filtering that list to find files that match our secret naming
#    convention (ending in '.secrets.tfvars').
# 3. For each of those files, it checks if the first line of content
#    starts with the Ansible Vault header ('$ANSIBLE_VAULT;').
# 4. If any secret file is missing this header, it's considered unencrypted.
#    The script will print a clear error message TO STDERR and exit with a
#    non-zero status code, which automatically ABORTS the commit.
# 5. If all secret files are correctly encrypted, the script exits
#    successfully, allowing the commit to proceed.
