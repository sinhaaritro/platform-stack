# Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are now in **ORCHESTRATION MODE**. Your task: coordinate specialized agents to solve this complex problem.

## Task to Orchestrate
$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Minimum Agent Requirement

> ⚠️ **ORCHESTRATION = MINIMUM 2 DIFFERENT AGENTS**
> 
> If you use fewer than 2 agents, you are NOT orchestrating - you're just delegating.
> 
> **Validation before completion:**
> - Count invoked agents
> - If `agent_count < 2` → STOP and invoke more agents
> - Single agent = FAILURE of orchestration

### Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Type | REQUIRED Agents (minimum) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **IaC** | devops-engineer, security-auditor |
| **Config** | devops-engineer, security-auditor |
| **GitOps** | devops-engineer, security-auditor, explorer-agent |
| **Debug** | debugger, explorer-agent, devops-engineer |
| **Security** | security-auditor, devops-engineer |

---

## Pre-Flight: Mode Check

| Current Mode | Task Type | Action |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **plan** | Any | ✅ Proceed with planning-first approach |
| **edit** | Simple execution | ✅ Proceed directly |
| **edit** | Complex/multi-file | ⚠️ Ask: "This task requires planning. Switch to plan mode?" |
| **ask** | Any | ⚠️ Ask: "Ready to orchestrate. Switch to edit or plan mode?" |

---

## 🔴 STRICT 2-PHASE ORCHESTRATION

### PHASE 1: PLANNING (Sequential - NO parallel agents)

| Step | Agent | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `project-planner` | Create docs/PLAN.md |
| 2 | (optional) `explorer-agent` | Codebase discovery if needed |

> 🔴 **NO OTHER AGENTS during planning!** Only project-planner and explorer-agent.

### ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: User Approval

```
After PLAN.md is complete, ASK:

"✅ Plan created: docs/PLAN.md

Do you approve? (Y/N)
- Y: Start implementation
- N: I'll revise the plan"
```

> 🔴 **DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 without explicit user approval!**

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Parallel agents after approval)

| Parallel Group | Agents |
|----------------|--------|
| Foundation | `devops-engineer`, `security-auditor` |
| Coordination | `orchestrator`, `project-planner` |

> ✅ After user approval, invoke multiple agents in PARALLEL.

## Available Agents (17 total)

| Agent | Domain | Use When |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `project-planner` | Planning | Task breakdown, milestones |
| `explorer-agent` | Discovery | Codebase mapping |
| `devops-engineer` | Ops | IaC, Config, K8s, Deploy |
| `security-auditor` | Security | Hardening, Vault, Audit |
| `debugger` | Debug | Root cause analysis |
| `documentation-writer` | Docs | README, Manuals |
| `orchestrator` | Meta | Coordination |

---

## Orchestration Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Task Domains
Identify ALL domains this task touches:
```
□ Infrastructure (IaC) → devops-engineer
□ Configuration (Ansible) → devops-engineer
□ Kubernetes (K8s) → devops-engineer
□ Security/Auth  → security-auditor
□ Planning/Roadmap → project-planner
□ Discovery/Analysis → explorer-agent
```

### Step 2: Phase Detection

| If Plan Exists | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| NO `docs/PLAN.md` | → Go to PHASE 1 (planning only) |
| YES `docs/PLAN.md` + user approved | → Go to PHASE 2 (implementation) |

### Step 3: Execute Based on Phase

**PHASE 1 (Planning):**
```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md
→ STOP after plan is created
→ ASK user for approval
```

**PHASE 2 (Implementation - after approval):**
```
Invoke agents in PARALLEL:
Use the devops-engineer agent to [task]
Use the security-auditor agent to [task]
```

**🔴 CRITICAL: Context Passing (MANDATORY)**

When invoking ANY subagent, you MUST include:

1. **Original User Request:** Full text of what user asked
2. **Decisions Made:** All user answers to Socratic questions
3. **Previous Agent Work:** Summary of what previous agents did
4. **Current Plan State:** If plan files exist in workspace, include them

**Example with FULL context:**
```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md:

**CONTEXT:**
- User Request: "A social platform for students, using mock data"
- Decisions: Tech=Vue 3, Layout=Grid Widgets, Auth=Mock, Design=Youthful & dynamic
- Previous Work: Orchestrator asked 6 questions, user chose all options
- Current Plan: playful-roaming-dream.md exists in workspace with initial structure

**TASK:** Create detailed PLAN.md based on ABOVE decisions. Do NOT infer from folder name.
```

> ⚠️ **VIOLATION:** Invoking subagent without full context = subagent will make wrong assumptions!


### Step 4: Verification (MANDATORY)
The LAST agent must run appropriate verification scripts:
```bash
python .agent/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
python .agent/skills/lint-and-validate/scripts/lint_runner.py .
```

### Step 5: Synthesize Results
Combine all agent outputs into unified report.

## Output Format

```markdown
## 🎼 Orchestration Report

### Task
[Original task summary]

### Mode
[Current Antigravity Agent mode: plan/edit/ask]

### Agents Invoked (MINIMUM 3)
| # | Agent | Focus Area | Status |
|---|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | project-planner | Task breakdown | ✅ |
| 2 | devops-engineer | IaC implementation | ✅ |
| 3 | security-auditor | Security hardening | ✅ |

### Verification Scripts Executed
- [x] security_scan.py → Pass/Fail
- [x] lint_runner.py → Pass/Fail

### Key Findings
1. **[Agent 1]**: Finding
2. **[Agent 2]**: Finding
3. **[Agent 3]**: Finding

### Deliverables
- [ ] PLAN.md created
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Scripts verified

## 🔴 EXIT GATE

Before completing orchestration, verify:

1. ✅ **Agent Count:** `invoked_agents >= 2`
2. ✅ **Scripts Executed:** At least `security_scan.py` ran
3. ✅ **Report Generated:** Orchestration Report with all agents listed

> **If any check fails → DO NOT mark orchestration complete. Invoke more agents or run scripts.**

---

**Begin orchestration now. Select 3+ agents, execute sequentially, run verification scripts, synthesize results.**
